# Carbon FootPrint Calculator

The purpose of our project is to create a carbon footprint calculator that helps users understand their environmental impact and provides actionable recommendations for reducing their carbon emissions. The calculator works by taking inputs from the user, such as travel distance, energy usage, and food consumption, and using industry standards to calculate the associated carbon emissions. Based on these emissions, the calculator provides personalized recommendations for reducing emissions in different categories, such as transportation, energy, food, and waste.

The goal of our project is to promote sustainability and encourage individuals to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. Climate change is a global problem that affects us all, and reducing carbon emissions is essential for mitigating its impacts. However, many people are unaware of their own carbon footprint and may not know how to take meaningful action to reduce it. By providing a user-friendly and personalized tool for calculating and reducing carbon emissions, we hope to empower individuals to make a positive impact on the environment.

Overall, our carbon footprint calculator addresses the problem of lack of awareness and knowledge about personal carbon emissions and provides a solution for taking meaningful action to reduce them.

# Carbon FootPrint Calculator

The purpose of our project is to create a carbon footprint calculator that helps users understand their environmental impact and provides actionable recommendations for reducing their carbon emissions. The calculator works by taking inputs from the user, such as travel distance, energy usage, and food consumption, and using industry standards to calculate the associated carbon emissions. Based on these emissions, the calculator provides personalized recommendations for reducing emissions in different categories, such as transportation, energy, food, and waste.

The goal of our project is to promote sustainability and encourage individuals to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. Climate change is a global problem that affects us all, and reducing carbon emissions is essential for mitigating its impacts. However, many people are unaware of their own carbon footprint and may not know how to take meaningful action to reduce it. By providing a user-friendly and personalized tool for calculating and reducing carbon emissions, we hope to empower individuals to make a positive impact on the environment.

Overall, our carbon footprint calculator addresses the problem of lack of awareness and knowledge about personal carbon emissions and provides a solution for taking meaningful action to reduce them.

Users can input their data by filling in the relevant fields, such as travel distance, energy usage, food consumption, and waste generation. Users can select their preferred unit of measurement for each category by choosing from a dropdown menu next to the input field.

Once all the inputs have been provided, the user can click on the "Calculate" button to initiate the calculation of their carbon footprint. The calculator uses the provided inputs and industry-standard formulas to calculate the user's carbon footprint.

After the calculation is complete, the user will receive their carbon footprint result, broken down by category. Additionally, the user will receive personalized recommendations on how to reduce their carbon footprint based on their inputs.

Here is an example screenshot of the user interface of our carbon footprint calculator:

Overall, our carbon footprint calculator is designed to be easy to use and visually appealing, while providing accurate calculations and actionable recommendations for reducing carbon emissions.
